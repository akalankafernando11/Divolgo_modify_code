Version 0.3.0

1. Display Information Feature:
    Battery status
    Charging status
    Connection status
    Active Schedule status
    OTA Update status

2. Enhanced OTA Update Check Logic:
    To initiate OTA update:
    Press and hold the power button until you see the update icon on the display under the following conditions:
    Device is plugged in for charging.
    Battery voltage exceeds 3.9V.

3. Automatic Rotation Stop Feature:
    Halts the current schedule on every RTC day 2 (Monday) if:
    The rotation started at least two days before day 2 (Monday).

4. Improved Device Startup Conditions:
    Device now starts only if remaining battery capacity is 40% or more.
    If battery capacity is below 40%, the device indicates Red LED flashes (Five blinks) and powers off.

Code Refinement:

Removed unused variables and unnecessary EEPROM allocations.
Utilizes RTC Ram memory instead of EEPROM for storing rotation image number.
Avoids rewriting EEPROM with the same value.
Optimized string data usage for Display options, reducing overall data consumption.
All compilation warnings has been cleared.
